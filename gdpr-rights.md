title: User Rights under the GDPR

And how to exercise them in the context of the Galaxy Service provided by the Norwegian NeLS Galaxy Team.


## Right to be Informed

We have published our documentation regarding GDPR compliance in these web pages.
We will inform you of any and all processing activities and their affect on your personal information.

## Right to Access to Personal Information

The only personal information we store that is associated with you, you can see on https://galaxy-\<uni\>.bioinfo.no/user.
We have logs containing IP addresses but these logs are destroyed at latest within 48 hours and are not associated with a single user account.

## Right to Rectification of Personal Information

You can request this via e-mail to nels@bioinfo.no.

## Right to Erasure

We can manually delete your account upon request. In the future this will be something you can do yourself when we can [implement the feature upstream](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/issues/6081). For now you can request erasure of your account via e-mail to nels@bioinfo.no.

## Right to Restrict Processing

All of the processing activities we currently do are required to use the service. We do not transmit any PII to third parties.

## Right to Data Portability

The upstream software Galaxy currently does not support this workflow, but does expose an interface that would allow us to do this. We are [working on the implementation](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/issues/6082).

## Right to Object

All of the processing activities we currently do are required to use the service. We do not transmit any PII to third parties.
If we do processing activities in the future that do affect PII, we will inform you and permit you to opt-out.

## Right to Not be Subject to Automated Decision-making Including Profiling

We do not profile our users, nor do any form of automated decision making based on personal data.
