And how to exercise them in the context of the ELIXIR Oslo Services (the "Services").

## Right to be Informed

We have published our documentation regarding GDPR compliance in these web pages.
We will inform you of any and all processing activities and their affect on your personal information.

## Right to Access to Personal Information

We only store Personally identifiable information (PII) in the ELIXIR Oslo services after you have been informed in detail about the
pieces of information we store, and you have explicitly accepted such storage. All personal information should be available from within the Services themselves. Regardless, we will, upon request,
provide you with access to all personal information we store about you.

In addition, as detailed in the [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.html), we may retain access and usage logs
containing IP addresses, referring pages and dates, but these logs are not associated with a single user account.

## Right to Rectification of Personal Information

If the Services do not support rectification of personal information, we can manually help you with this upon your request via e-mail to [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

## Right to Erasure

We can manually delete your account upon your request via e-mail to [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

## Right to Restrict Processing

All the processing activities we currently carry out are required for operations of the Services. We do not transmit any PII to third parties.

## Right to Data Portability

The ELIXIR Oslo services should provide features for exporting user data in commonly used formats. If such features
are not available, or you need help using them, please contact us via e-mail at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

## Right to Object

All the processing activities we currently carry out are required for operations of the Services. We do not transmit any PII to third parties.
If we carry out processing activities in the future that do affect PII, we will inform you and permit you to opt-out.

## Right to Not be Subject to Automated Decision-making Including Profiling

We do not profile our users, nor carry out any form of automated decision making based on personal data.
