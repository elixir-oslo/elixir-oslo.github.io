## Introduction

The Oslo node of ELIXIR Norway is aware the protection of your privacy is important when using our Services. 
We provide this statement to explain our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your 
information is collected and used. The amount and type of information received by us depends on how you use our Services.

## Privacy regulations of the University of Oslo

All data collected and processed by the ELIXIR Oslo services are subject to the 
[Privacy declarations](https://www.uio.no/english/about/regulations/privacy-declarations/index.html) of
the University of Oslo. In case of discrepancies between the Privacy declarations of the University of Oslo and the
Privacy Policy of the ELIXIR Oslo services, the former takes precedence.

## Information collected and use of information

During normal usage of our Services we do not collect information that will be used to personally identify you. Our webservers
store information such as IP addresses, the Referrer (where you came to us from), pages that you access, and dates and 
timepoints for your visits, but these logs are not associated with a single user account. We may use this information in 
anonymised aggregates in order to generate usage statistics and to improve the usefulness of our Services. Logs 
containing information as detailed in this paragraph will be automatically encrypted within a week, and stored at 
most for 12 months before they are automatically deleted.

Beyond this, we will only store personal information which you provide to us voluntarily and which is 
available to you from the user interface (e.g. uploaded datasets, job execution histories, etc.), or as part 
of support requests. From the user interface of the Services, you should be able to see all of the information we have 
stored related to your person and you have the right to correct this information at any time. 
For <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/">Galaxy</a>-based servers you may do this by clicking on the "User" menu and 
selecting "Preferences". 

The information required to register with ELIXIR Oslo services and all uploaded data is 
solely used to offer the services provided by the Oslo node of ELIXIR Norway. Access is provided through 
authentication using your FEIDE user identity, your NeLS IdP user identity, your ELIXIR AAI user identity, 
other per-service registration solutions, or in some cases anonymously. You will be informed about the exact
pieces of information that is registered in our Services when first logging in. Possible authentication 
methods are defined at a per-service basis in order to guarantee the legitimate use of the Services and
to prevent duplicate registrations. 

You have the right to retract your consent to use personal identifiable information at any time with 
effect for the future. An email to the address stated below is sufficient. We never use or share the 
personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above.

## Cookies

A cookie is a unique identifier given to a web browser by a web server. Each time the browser requests a page from 
the server, this identifier is sent back. Most ELIXIR Oslo services use cookies to identify users/computers in 
order to maintain the user sessions (e.g. to provide/maintain analysis results while you browse the website). These 
cookies do not contain information that can be used to identify you as a user. The information is also not 
shared with any third parties. Most browsers are set to automatically accept cookies. If you prefer not to receive 
cookies, you may set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, or you may also refuse all cookies by turning 
them off in your browser. However, please be aware that in case of not accepting cookies, the functionality of our 
Services might be limited.

## Links to Other Websites

This Privacy Statement only covers the ELIXIR Oslo services. Links within this 
website to other websites are not covered by this statement. Please be aware that linked websites could store 
information in a way which does not comply with this statement, as soon as these websites are accessed. 
We cannot accept any responsibility for the collection, processing, use and passing on of information in
such cases.

## Changes

We reserve the right to amend or correct this Privacy Statement at any time. The revised statement will be 
posted on the website and will only apply to data collected after the effective date of the revised statement.
